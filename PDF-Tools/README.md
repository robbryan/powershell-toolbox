# PDF-Tools
A repository of PowerShell scripts to work with PDF files.

## Get-PDFVersion
A simple 'advanced' function (?!) that takes PDF files on the pipeline and reads their PDF version.
This is useful as some COTS products do not support the features of later PDF versions.
Requires the [iTextSharp.dll](https://github.com/itext/itextsharp "iTextSharp on GitHub")
