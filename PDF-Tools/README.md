# PDF-Tools  

A repository of PowerShell scripts to work with PDF files.  

---  

## Get-PDFVersion  
A simple ['advanced' function](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847743.aspx) (?!) that takes PDF files on the pipeline and reads their PDF version.  
This is useful as some COTS products do not support the features of later PDF versions.  
Requires [iTextSharp.dll](https://github.com/itext/itextsharp "iTextSharp on GitHub").
